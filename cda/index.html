        The Community Digital Access Project builds professional, accessible websites for
        individuals and organizations who lack access to digital tools — including small businesses,
        community programs, youth initiatives, wellness and mental health practitioners,
        educational projects, and NGOs.

  <!-- PROBLEM -->
  <section class="section">
    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>
      Individuals and community-focused initiatives often rely on social media or informal
      networks to reach people. Without a professional website, they face limited visibility,
      reduced trust, missed funding opportunities, and restricted growth.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SOLUTION -->
  <section class="section alt">
    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>
      We design and build simple, modern, and accessible websites that communicate clarity,
      trust, and purpose. Each website supports people and organizations in sharing knowledge,
      services, and opportunities with their communities.
